File Encryption/Decryption Tool
Description: This project allows you to encrypt and decrypt files using a symmetric key encryption algorithm (AES). You can use it to protect sensitive files from unauthorized access.

Instructions:

1.Open the C# file and compile the code using a C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or .NET CLI).
2. Place the input file (input.txt) you want to encrypt in the same directory as the compiled executable.
3. Run the executable; it will encrypt the file and save the encrypted content in encrypted.txt.
4. To decrypt the file, run the executable again; it will read the encrypted file and produce the original content in decrypted.txt.
